Hi, if you have a question to buy a lawnmower, I will always help http://www.indiepict.com . Lawn mowers - and your lawn will be irresistible! Thanks to them, we can mow grass with little effort and keep the lawn in tidy condition. In the article, I will talk about what lawn mowers are and how to make the best choice.
The most important point, as experts advise, is to clearly understand before buying how to use the lawn mower. How much work will you do, what are the landscape characteristics of the site, are there any trees on the site, is there any possibility of connecting to electricity.
Having clearly realized the task you will be doing, you can proceed to the selection of the lawn mower
The lawn mower is mechanical - the cutting process occurs during movement, the built-in knives, rotating, cut the grass.
They have several advantages compared to other types of lawn mowers:
• The whole haircut process is absolutely mechanical, so there is no noise from the motor running and no emissions that pollute the environment.
• Cuts off a larger layer of grass compared to other lawn mowers.
• Not unimportant factor - cheapness. The price of the device itself is lower compared to other types of lawn mowers, and there is no additional waste on gasoline or electricity.
It is worth noting the disadvantages:
• The lawn should be small!
• Physical efforts, during shearing, will have to be applied an order of magnitude more than with electric or gasoline lawn mowers.
Indisputable plus: Haircut like scissors. Grass mows better and stays green longer. The tips of the grass do not turn yellow
To summarize: you can use mechanical lawn mowers in small, flat areas. If the disadvantages of a mechanical lawn mower do not bother you, then this is a great choice.
Common in electric and gasoline lawn mowers: they have a tank for collecting mowed grass, or if you do not want to collect grass in the collection, the mower can evenly scatter the mowed grass on the lawn, fertilizing it. Depending on how the knives are fixed, lawn mowers are divided into rotor and spindle.
The electric mower motor that rotates the knives, you just set the direction of movement and follow the process. To get started, you do not need any special skills: connect to the network, forward the carry over, press the start button and go ahead. Very easy to maintain, operate and store. No exhaust to the environment. Electric lawn mowers can still be divided into two types: rechargeable and from the network. Cordless are more mobile and there is no wire that always interferes with work, but the time is limited.
To summarize: electric lawn mowers are good to use near the house or on a small summer cottage, where there is a power source nearby. Reliable, easy to maintain and do not require special knowledge to run and work. You can buy an electric rechargeable lawn mower, but the charge will last for a couple of hours, you decide.
